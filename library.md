Heya, this is the first part of the diplomacy mechanic you're building. Please tell me if you find the dialog/ideas appropriate or if you want to change any part.


Regarding the diplomacy mechanic, here's what I've come up with: When you first build a library, the human emissary (a master at arms given to you by the kingdom, can work as a normal unit or only appears during specific dialogs) will inform you that you can have the mages send out messages to different factions to establish friendly ties with them.

Emissary: My lord, did you know that there are mages specialized in long-range communication?
You: Yes, they were the ones sending out his highness messages to my family after all. I have also seen several of them working at the royal palace.
Emissary: *chuckle* Magic has certainly brought about great benefits to our kingdom, hasn't it? When I was but a lad, I wouldn't have believed that mages would be able to raise mountains out of thin air... Well, let's get back to our previous topic for now.
Emissary: Having friends that we can rely on out here at the frontier is more important than you can imagine. As such, his highness has given us permission to make contact with other kingdoms and establish friendly ties with them.
Emissary: As an ally, they can send their mercenaries to fight for us or even mobilize a large group of veterans to our aid. Caravans heading towards friendly territory will also be able to trade their goods at a better price as well!
Emissary: Of course, the opposite holds true. It's best that you choose your friends carefully, my lord...
Narration: You can right-click on a library to initiate the diplomacy option. Completing specific tasks assigned by a faction will make them more friendly towards you. Being allied to a faction will give you the most benefits, though there can also be several drawbacks.
Narration: The lush forests of the elves lie west of your town. To the east, massive dwarvish strongholds span the entire mountain ranges, protecting their luxurious mines. The Northern Alliance controls most of the north, though there has been several disputes between your kingdom and theirs. Finally, you came from the west, carrying proud Wesnothian blood in your vein.
Narration: There are also minor factions such as outlaw, undead, orc, saurian and drake. They don't have a kingdom to call their own, yet rumors speak of influential individuals holding control over the majority of each group.
Narration: The king has given you his blessing to make contact with kingdoms of elves, dwarves or the Northern Alliance. Some merchants are curious about the drakes and saurians, yet these races rarely show any interest towards trading with humans. Outlaws roam the highways to steal goods from caravans, while orcs and undeads will even rob the innocent of their life.
Narration: Choose your allies carefully, for it could aslo determine your enemies as well.
Emissary: When you initiate negotiation with anyone for the first time, you will have to send them some gifts first. 200 gold from our treasury should convince them of our good will.
You: Alright. After I make a decision, I will talk to you again.
You: By the way, you were joking about the mages and mountains, right?
Emissary: *chuckle* Let a mage stand on top the hill and you can see for yourself.
